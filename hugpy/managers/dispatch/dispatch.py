"""Runner dispatch — dumb consumer of Resolution.

All routing logic lives in model_resolver.resolve(). This module owns
two things and only two things:

    1. A per-process instance cache keyed by (model_key, task).
    2. An execute_prompt entry point that turns request kwargs into
       a result by handing off to resolve() and the runner.

It does not:
    - Decide which builder to call.
    - Decide which runner class to instantiate.
    - Validate that model+task are compatible.
    - Default task to cfg.primary_task.

If you find yourself adding any of that here, stop and add it to
model_resolver.resolve() instead. That's the whole point.

Why a per-process cache:
    Loading a 14B model takes seconds; doing it on every request is
    obviously wrong. Per-(model_key, task) caching means the same
    model can host two task-runners (e.g. text-generation + code-
    generation on one llama.cpp instance) and each gets its own
    runner wrapper, but inner singletons (REGISTRY for DeepCoder,
    get_llama_runner for llama.cpp) still de-dup the heavy state.
