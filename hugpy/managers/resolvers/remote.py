"""Remote execution runners + the worker-provider seam.

resolve() is the single routing authority. When a (model_key, task) should not
run in-process, resolve() swaps the local runner class for one of these:

  * PeerRunner       — static placement.json delegation to another *central*
                       node's POST /api/llm/execute (one-shot). "System A".
  * DelegatingRunner — dynamic offload to a live GPU *worker* from the pool,
                       re-selected on every call, with automatic local
                       fallback. Streams via the worker's /infer/stream and
                       one-shots via /infer. "System B".

Both used to be two unrelated code paths (peers decided inside resolve(), the
worker pool decided in the chat route). Folding the worker pool in here is the
whole point: routing is decided in exactly one place again, and worker offload
now applies to every task and to both run() and stream().

Layering: the worker pool lives in the web layer (it persists next to the model
manifest and is mutated by the /llm/workers routes). To keep this core module
from importing the web layer, the web layer *injects* its selector via
set_worker_provider() at import time. The standalone worker agent never imports
the web layer, so no provider is registered there and DelegatingRunner simply
always runs local — and remote payloads carry _force_local so the far side
never re-delegates (loop guard).
