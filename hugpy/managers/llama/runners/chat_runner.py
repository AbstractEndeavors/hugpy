"""Llama.cpp chat runner.

Adapter over the existing LlamaCppPythonRunner / LlamaCppRunner (HTTP).
Both are kept in their per-process singleton cache (get_llama_runner),
so the heavy GGUF load happens once per model_key regardless of how
many adapter wrappers exist.

Constructor signature is uniform with the other runners in _RUNNERS:
    __init__(self, cfg: ModelConfig, **runtime_kwargs)

This matches what dispatch._get_or_build_runner expects, so the
dispatch table can stay a flat (framework, task) -> class mapping
without any per-runner adapter logic.
