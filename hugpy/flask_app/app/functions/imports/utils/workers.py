"""GPU worker registry.

A *worker* is a remote box that runs the standalone worker agent
(``hugpy.worker_agent``), exposes an HTTP inference endpoint, and
joins this central node so its GPU(s) can serve one or more models from the
manifest.

This module is the single source of truth for the pool. It owns:

    - persistence of the worker list to a JSON file beside the model manifest
      (so the pool survives restarts),
    - registration / heartbeat / removal,
    - model assignment (which worker may serve which model_key),
    - liveness (a worker is ``online`` only if it has heartbeat-ed recently),
    - selection (pick an online worker that is assigned + ready for a model).

Routing (chat/streaming) and the ``/llm/workers`` routes are dumb consumers of
the functions exported here.
