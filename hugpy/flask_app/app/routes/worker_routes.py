"""HTTP surface for the GPU worker pool.

These endpoints serve two audiences:

  * the worker agent (machine-to-machine):
        POST /llm/workers/register
        POST /llm/workers/<id>/heartbeat
  * the console UI (human-driven):
        GET    /llm/workers
        GET    /llm/workers/<id>
        DELETE /llm/workers/<id>
        POST   /llm/workers/<id>/assign      {"model_key": ..., "spill": {...}?}
        POST   /llm/workers/<id>/unassign    {"model_key": ...}
  * model provisioning (worker pulls files from central over WireGuard):
        GET    /llm/models/<model_key>/manifest      file list + sizes + meta
        GET    /llm/models/<model_key>/file?path=..  stream one file (Range ok)

All registry state lives in functions.imports.utils.workers; this module only
translates HTTP <-> that store. get_bp, the worker_store helpers,
get_models_dict, get_model_config and route_destination are all re-exported
through functions/__init__ (imports → utils), mirroring how
llm_storage_routes.py pulls its registry helpers.
