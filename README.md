# hugpy — run your own models, your own way

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hugpy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/hugpy/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/hugpy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/hugpy/)

**A self-hosted LLM console and OpenAI-compatible API in a single process.**
Model registry & downloads, streaming chat, an OpenAI-compatible `/v1` surface
with on-site API keys, and a GPU worker fleet with cross-machine RPC sharding —
all served by one command, with no nginx and no Node required.

```bash
pip install hugpy
hugpy serve            # console at http://localhost:7002/ , API at /api/v1
```

That's the whole product: the built web console rides inside the wheel, so the
one process gives you a browser UI **and** a programmable API.

## Why hugpy

Most "run a model" tools stop at load-and-infer. hugpy is the operational layer
around self-hosting:

- **One process, whole product.** `hugpy serve` runs the API, the web console,
  model downloads, chat, and the OpenAI `/v1` surface. No reverse proxy, no
  separate frontend build.
- **OpenAI-compatible.** Point any OpenAI SDK at your box — `base_url` + an
  `hp_…` key and you're done.
- **Bring your own GPUs.** Join any machine to a central as a worker
  (`hugpy worker`), or lend its GPU to a **cross-machine shard pool** so models
  larger than one card can run across several boxes over RPC.
- **Phone-to-server install.** The base install is small and wheels-only (it
  runs on Termux/aarch64 as a coordinator); the heavy engine, vision, OCR, and
  scraping stacks are opt-in extras that the code lazy-imports only when used.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install hugpy            # base: console + API, wheels-only
```

The base package deliberately omits native/compiled heavyweights so it installs
anywhere (including phones and coordinator-only boxes). Add capabilities with
extras:

| Extra | Adds | Use it for |
|-------|------|------------|
| `engine` | `llama-cpp-python` | In-process **GGUF** inference (`[llama]` is an alias) |
| `transformers` | `torch`, `transformers`, `accelerate` | Transformers/PyTorch backends |
| `vision` | `opencv-python-headless`, `onnxruntime` | Local image/object detection |
| `ocr` | `abstract_ocr`, `pytest` | OCR stack (desktop/server only) |
| `web` | `abstract_webtools` | Web extraction / scraping |
| `embed` | `sentence-transformers` | Embeddings |
| `finetune` | `peft` | Fine-tuning helpers |
| `gpu` | `pynvml` | Richer GPU probing (else falls back to `nvidia-smi`) |
| `bot` | `discord.py`, `python-dotenv` | The Discord bot arm |
| `server` | engine + bot + gpu + data/runtime deps | A central/coordinator box |
| `all` | server + vision + ocr + web + transformers + embed + finetune | Full desktop/server install |

```bash
pip install "hugpy[engine]"          # local GGUF inference
pip install "hugpy[server]"          # a coordinator that hosts the console + fleet
pip install "hugpy[all]"             # everything
```

**CUDA-accelerated engine** (rebuild `llama-cpp-python` against CUDA):

```bash
CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on" pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir llama-cpp-python
```

Requires **Python ≥ 3.10**.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. start the console + API (single-operator, no login wall by default)
hugpy serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7002

# 2. open the console
#    → http://localhost:7002/

# 3. (optional) provision the native llama.cpp binaries for the serve drivers
hugpy install-engine            # add --cuda for a CUDA build
```

Download a model and chat from the console, or drive it over the API below.

---

## OpenAI-compatible API

`hugpy serve` exposes an OpenAI-compatible surface at both `/v1` and `/api/v1`.

### Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:7002/v1",   # or https://your-hugpy/api/v1
    api_key="hp_your_key_here",            # mint keys in the console
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="your-model-key",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one line."}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in resp:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

### curl

```bash
# list models
curl http://localhost:7002/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer hp_your_key_here"

# chat completion (streaming)
curl http://localhost:7002/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hp_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"your-model-key","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}],"stream":true}'
```

**API keys.** Keys (`hp_…`) are minted and revoked in the console (or via the
same-origin `/keys` endpoints). A `require_key` flag decides whether `/v1` calls
must present `Authorization: Bearer hp_…`. The `/v1` surface is public/
programmatic; the console's own routes (model management, jobs, workers) live on
the same origin and are governed by the site's auth mode, not `/v1` keys.

Other notable endpoints served by the same process include `/health`,
`/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, model management (`/models`, `/llm/*`),
background jobs (`/jobs`), the worker fleet (`/llm/workers/*`), and the Discord
bridge (`/discord/*`). Every path is reachable both bare (`/health`) and
`/api`-prefixed (`/api/health`).

---

## Command-line interface

The package installs a single `hugpy` entry point:

```
hugpy serve           run the console + API in one process
hugpy worker          join this machine to a central as a GPU worker
hugpy bot             run the Discord bot (drives a central over HTTP)
hugpy keeper          terminal "keeper" REPL — a model keeps this machine/LXD instance
hugpy install-engine  download or build the native llama.cpp binaries
```

### `hugpy serve`

```bash
hugpy serve [--host 0.0.0.0] [--port 7002] [--threads 8]
            [--auth open|external] [--origins a.com,b.com] [--debug]
```

Serves via gunicorn on POSIX, waitress on Windows, and falls back to the Flask
dev server if neither is installed.

### `hugpy install-engine`

```bash
hugpy install-engine [--cuda] [--build-from-source] [--tag <release>] [--jobs N] [--force]
```

Fetches a prebuilt `llama-server` / `rpc-server` (or builds from source with
`--build-from-source`, which needs git + cmake).

---

## GPU worker fleet & sharding

Turn any GPU box into capacity for a central instance:

```bash
# on the GPU machine
hugpy worker --central https://your-hugpy/        # join as a worker
```

For models larger than a single card, hugpy can split a GGUF model **across
machines** over llama.cpp RPC: the central's allocator coordinates a pool of
`rpc-server` backends. This is opt-in (`HUGPY_SHARD_MODELS`) and configured with
`HUGPY_RPC_SERVERS` / `HUGPY_TENSOR_SPLIT` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
All flags after `worker` are passed straight to the worker agent's own parser
(`hugpy worker --help`).

### Admission, dedicated pools & self-update

- **Admission.** A newly-joined worker is `pending` and serves nothing until an
  operator **Admits** it in the console. Set `HUGPY_WORKER_ENROLL_REQUIRED=1` to
  also require a one-time enrollment token (`WORKER_ENROLL_TOKEN`).
- **Dedicated pools.** Reserve a worker for one app by starting it with
  `WORKER_POOL=<name>`: it then serves *only* requests tagged for that pool, and
  general traffic never lands on it. Tag requests by minting an API key bound to
  the pool, or with an explicit per-request `pool`; a pool request with no
  matching worker falls back to local rather than the shared fleet. Pooled
  workers eagerly pre-warm their assigned models (`WORKER_PRELOAD`).
- **Self-update.** Workers converge to the central's target version via
  `pip install -U` + re-exec — from PyPI by default, or from central's bundled
  PEP-503 index (`--pkg-index <central>/api/llm/pip/simple`) for egress-less
  boxes. A single publish rolls the fleet.
- **Even a phone can help.** The `phone_brick` arm runs ONNX object detection
  across cheap Android phones, and a phone can join the shard pool as a
  `role=rpc` llama.cpp backend (`PHONE_BRICK_RPC=1`) — lending its RAM as
  pseudo-VRAM to models too big for one card.

---

## Discord bot

The bot arm drives a hugpy central over HTTP — it can point at this machine or a
remote central.

```bash
pip install "hugpy[bot]"
hugpy bot --central http://127.0.0.1:7002 --env /path/to/.env
```

The `.env` supplies `DISCORD_TOKEN` and bot settings (or set `HUGPY_BOT_ENV`).
Restrict slash-command sync to one guild with `--guild <id>`.

---

## Configuration

hugpy is configured by environment variables. The most useful:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DEFAULT_ROOT` | Root directory for model weights, manifests, and data |
| `HUGPY_AUTH_MODE` | `open` (default, no login wall) or `external` (front a real auth service) |
| `HUGPY_AUTO_DOWNLOAD` | Auto-fetch missing models on demand |
| `HUGPY_BASE_URL` | Central base URL used by `hugpy bot` / clients |
| `HUGPY_DATA_DIR` / `HUGPY_CONFIG_DIR` / `HUGPY_CACHE_DIR` | Per-OS data/config/cache overrides |
| `HUGPY_ENGINE_DIR` / `HUGPY_ENGINE_TAG` | Native engine location / llama.cpp release tag |
| `HUGPY_N_GPU` / `HUGPY_N_GPU_LAYERS` / `HUGPY_MAIN_GPU` | GPU offload controls |
| `HUGPY_TENSOR_SPLIT` | Per-GPU split for multi-GPU / sharded serving |
| `HUGPY_SHARD_MODELS` | Enable cross-machine GGUF sharding |
| `HUGPY_RPC_SERVERS` / `HUGPY_SHARD_PORT_BASE` | RPC backend pool for sharding |
| `WORKER_POOL` / `WORKER_PRELOAD` | Reserve a worker for a dedicated pool; eager-warm its models |
| `HUGPY_WORKER_ENROLL_REQUIRED` / `WORKER_PKG_INDEX` | Require enrollment tokens; worker self-update index |
| `PHONE_BRICK_RPC` | Let a phone join the shard pool as a `role=rpc` backend |
| `HUGPY_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECS` / `HUGPY_MAX_CONTINUATIONS` | SSE keepalive; unbounded-continuation clamp |
| `HUGPY_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | Max upload size for `/uploads` (default 100) |
| `HUGPY_PER_PASS_MAX_TOKENS` | Cap tokens per generation pass |
| `HUGPY_UI_DIST` | Override the path to the built web console |

CLI flags take precedence over the corresponding environment variables (e.g.
`hugpy serve --auth external` sets `HUGPY_AUTH_MODE`).

---

## Storage & paths

Large artifacts (weights, snapshots, caches) live under `DEFAULT_ROOT` (or the
per-OS data dir resolved via `platformdirs`). Point `DEFAULT_ROOT` at a big,
shared volume for server installs rather than your home directory. The built web
console ships inside the wheel (`console_dist/`), so no separate asset hosting is
needed.

---

## Authentication

- **`open`** (default): single-operator instance, no login wall. The `/v1`
  API-key system still gates programmatic access.
- **`external`**: the console authenticates against a separate auth service.
  hugpy includes a same-origin auth proxy so the session cookie stays
  first-party (works in Safari/Firefox, which block third-party cookies). Toggle
  with `HUGPY_AUTH_PROXY`; point it at the upstream with `HUGPY_AUTH_BASE`.

---

## Platform notes

- **Base install is wheels-only** and runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and
  Termux/aarch64 (as a coordinator). Heavy stacks are extras.
- **Windows**: served via `waitress` (gunicorn is POSIX-only). The CLI falls
  back to the Flask dev server if neither is present.
- **Android/Termux**: the GGUF engine, OCR (paddle), and some vision wheels are
  not available; install those extras only on desktop/server. See below.

### Mobile / Termux (Android)

`hugpy` installs and imports on Termux as a coordinator/worker. The
one historical blocker was `pydantic_core` (pydantic v2's Rust core), which has
no Termux wheel. The package now ships a **pure-Python pydantic fallback**: if
`pydantic_core` can't be imported, a lightweight shim is used automatically so
`import hugpy` succeeds with no Rust toolchain. The shim covers
model construction and serialization but **does not validate types** — fine for
running a phone as a coordinator/worker.

```bash
pkg install python                       # Termux
pip install hugpy
python -c "import hugpy; print('ok')"
```

If you want **full pydantic validation** on the phone (or hit a dependency that
truly needs the real `pydantic_core`), install a Rust toolchain so pip can build
it from source:

```bash
pkg install rust binutils
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1                 # avoid OOM on low-RAM devices
pip install --no-cache-dir pydantic
```
